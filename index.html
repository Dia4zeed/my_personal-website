      <p class="p1">
        I came a long way to this point, and I did a lot of things in my life. I started my career in media 
        , then I worked as a film critic and columnist, then a TV producer. In 2013 I migrated from Egypt to Germany.
        Now I'm learning marketing and web development at the age of 47, and yet
        I'm a proud of what I'm doing and I'm good at it ðŸ‘Œ .

        <h3>Creative writing and web Development</h3>
        <p class="p2">
          I started writing at the age of 6. Almost fourty years later, I started
          learning web Development, but I'm doing both very well. You are
          presently seeing a sample of my work.

        <h3 class="T">Things I love</h3>
        <p class="p3">
          I love cinema. I wrote, produced and directed some docs. I also
          launched a Festival in Germany for the North African/Middle East Films
          in 2016. Apart from that, my favourite being (I don't like to call them animals ðŸ˜‡) is The Elephant. I love elephants ðŸ’“ . They are very smart, very emotional, and
          the real Kings Of The Jungle. They also represtent a lot in our
          folklore as african people. To me, elephants are symbols of wisdom and the relativity of truth!
